# things to do at 8am run the following in python terminal 
# docker-compose up --build
# Access your applications in a web browser:
# -Django REST API at http://localhost:8000
# Next.js App at http://localhost:3000
*/Next.js App at http://localhost:3000
Step 8: Test Your Application
Ensure that both applications are running correctly.
Test API endpoints from Django in Postman or through a browser.
Verify that your Next.js application can fetch data from the Django API.
Step 9: Share Your Project
Push to GitHub: Make sure to include a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files (like node_modules, .env, etc.).
Documentation: Write clear instructions in a README.md file explaining how to clone and run your project using Docker.*/
